# Exercism  

Exercism is an online platform designed to help you improve your coding skills through practice and mentorship. There several computer languages to choose and I have chosen Javascript as my track.

You complete a challenge by downloading the exercise to your computer and solving it in your normal working environment. Once you've finished you submit it online to the Exercism homepage where mentors will give you feedback on how to improve the code. After a couple of rounds of refactoring, the exercise will be complete and the next core exercise will be unlocked. 

Meanwhile waiting for the feedback by the mentors there are related side-exercises to practice on.
